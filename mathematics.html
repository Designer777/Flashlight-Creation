  <h3> Modelling The Seebeck Effect Mathematically </h3>
  <p> V = αΔT </p>
  <ul>
    <li> Where V is the voltage </li>
    <li> Where α is the Seebeck coefficient (Different Metals Have Different Coefficients!) </li>
    <li> Where ΔT is the difference in temperature between the hot and cool ends of the two junctions </li>
  </ul>
  <h3> The Seebeck Coefficient </h3>
  <li> It is the amount of voltage produced between the two conductors when the temperature across them is sustained at 1 Kelvin (K) </li>
