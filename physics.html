      <h1> The Physics Behind Our Flashlight </h1>
    </header>
    <h3> How Does Our Flashlight Work? </h3>
    <li> For our flashlight, we will include a Thermoelectric Generator that converts temperature differences into electric voltage using a DC (Direct Current) power source. </li>
    <li> The Seebeck Effect helps generate the voltage. This voltage along with the current can produce power at a load. </li>
    <li> The Seebeck Effect occurs due to a movement of charged carriers (particles that move freely and contain charge) within this semiconductor. </li>
    <h3> The Seebeck Effect </h3>
    <li> It is the production of an electromotive force. </li>
    <li> As a result, there is an electrical current in a loop of material which consist of two dissimilar conductors or semiconductors when one junction is heated and one junction is kept cool. </li>
    <li> However, the voltage that is produced by this effect is very small (a few microvolts) </li>
    <li> If the temperature difference between the two junctions are large enough, there might be a millivolts that can be produced. </li>
    <li> Many devices that use the Seebeck effect can be connected in series to increase the output voltage or connected in parallel to increase the deliverable current </li>

    <h3> Semiconductors (In the Seebeck Effect) </h3>
    <li> There is a n-type semiconductor, a p-type semiconductor and a metal that connects the two semiconductors in series. </li>
    <li> Within the n-type semiconductors, there are negatively charged carries which are electrons. N-type semiconductors are pentavalent. (5 electrons in its outermost orbit). </li>
    <li> Within the p-type semiconductors, there is a  hole. There is a hole because p-type semiconductors are trivalent (3 electrons in its outermost orbit). However, it lacks one valence electron in order to become a typical semiconductor. </li>
    <h3> Explaining the Process For How The Flashlight Works </h3>
    <li> When heat is applied, the heated electrons at the n-type semiconductor recieve this thermal energy. </li>
    <li> These heated electrons flow from the hotter junction to the cooler junction. </li>
    <li> The hotter end has a lower density of charge carriers, which are the electrons of the n-type semiconductor and the holes of the p-type semiconductor. </li>
    <li> The cold end has a higher density of charge carriers. </li>
    <li> As a result, this distribution of charge carriers results in an electric field that is produced. </li>
    <li> Therefore, when a conductor connects the two ends of the junctions, charges begin to flow which form an electrical current. </li>
    <h3> Advantages of A Thermoelectric Geneator (Which uses The Seebeck Effect) </h3>
